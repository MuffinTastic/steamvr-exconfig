# SteamVR External Configurator

In situations where I'm testing something, I get annoyed with having to open SteamVR, wait for all my third-party overlays and drivers I usually use to start up, then go into settings and disable them, and restart, only then being able to do what I wanted to do in the first place.

This tool saves me at least a few seconds of precious life.

Downloads in Releases if you fancy.
